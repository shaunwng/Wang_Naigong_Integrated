## 2020 Fall Final Integrated Project
Welcome to this repository. This is Naigong Wang's final integrated project. There are three pages website based on the HTML/CSS include home, menu and reservation. The object for this assignment is all about fine dinning restaurant. These three web pages will present what is fine dinning restaurant via some details like logo, color theme, font style, etc. It will let you experience the meticulous service start from the click. My inspiration comes from my chef experience before, I take this project as the "real" webpage design if I will run a restaurant. Hope you will like it.
